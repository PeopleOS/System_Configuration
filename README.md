# System_Configuration
This [git repository][about git repos - freecodecamp.org] contains the files that configure my personal computers - defines how they're set up. I am including instructions for how to set up your computers in the same way.

## Operating System
Often when we identify a computer, saying what "kind" of computer it is, such as "Windows", "XP", or "Mac", we're talking about its Operating System. A computer's operating system is a its most important program.

For all of my computers, I use some version of an operating system often called "Gnu/Linux." Usually we say "Linux" (lynn-ucks) for short.

## Shell Language

For lots of things on my computer, I use the terminal or command line. (insert image and reference to popular media) The terminal responds to commands that I give it in a computer language categorized as a "shell language" or "scripting language." (explain) The shell that I use is called fish (Friendly Interactive SHell).
